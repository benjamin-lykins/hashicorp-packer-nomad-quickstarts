This folder has many of the template files used to configure Nomad clients and servers via Ansible.

Each file contains comments at the top explaining its purpose and providing links to relevant documentation for further customization and understanding.

I intentionally broke this out much more heavily than usual to provide clarity on each configuration aspect and to make it easier to customize specific parts of the Nomad configuration without having to sift through a monolithic config file.
